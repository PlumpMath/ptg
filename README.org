#+OPTIONS: toc:nil num:nil

* ptg

A simple tool to grid photos or other images prior to transfer to
canvas or panel, similar to methods used by photorealists and other
artists (example [[http://legionofhonor.famsf.org/blog/invisible-man-self-portrait-chuck-close][here]]).

Written in [[http://clojure.org][Clojure]].  Uses [[https://github.com/daveray/seesaw][Seesaw]] and [[https://github.com/mikera/imagez][Imagez]].

** Usage:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
lein run <filename>
#+END_EXAMPLE
or
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
lein uberjar
java -jar target/ptg-<version>-standalone.jar <filename>
#+END_EXAMPLE

Then, adjust size/grid settings as appropriate, take a screen shot,
then crop (until I implement Save).

** Example screen shot

** Work to do:

- Implement XOR grid rather than black grid
- Implement draggable grid
- Implement Load/Save functionality
- Implement drag and drop
- Package into app
